# Trevor Lahey

Javascript bookmark that merges a PR using the squash commit strategy. The commit title
corresponds to the PR title (including the PR number for easy lookup) and the commit
message corresponds to changes inside the PR, denoted either by `## Changes` or `** Changes`,
followed by either another headline, another bold text, a gif, or until the end of the string.

## Usage

* Make a new bookmark prefixed with `javascript: `.
* Copy paste `index.js` in front of colon.
* Click to use!
